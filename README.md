- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bavanya
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in solving problems using technology and engineering new products that make lives easier. I am also interested in personal growth.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently investing most of my time developing strong fundamentals in core concepts of computer science and essential mathematics for machine learning, and improving my literacy skills.
